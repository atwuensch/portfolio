### Final Changes

My user interviews in Part Two really helped clarify the changes I needed to make to finish up my project. Something that was at first a little muddied and unclear to me was who my audience would be. I think that in the back of my mind, I love local government so much and am so passionate about it that I also want other people to be passionate about it. However, while you can try to persuade people, you can't necessarily make them care, so it helped distill my points more to imagine reaching an audience who was already civically engaged, in community groups or otherwise, in and around Allegheny County and Pittsburgh. My audience cares about what is happening in their community already and are actively seeking other ways to improve it. They may not be aware of the power of local government, as many people aren't. To that end, I added more text on why it matters to be involved in local government. To be honest, I struggled with that a bit because I already care so much, and it was helpful to be reminded in my user feedback and other feedback that it's not that people don't care, they just don't know what I'm talking about. 

Another point the professor made that I found helpful was imagining a worst-case scenario if people don't get involved, so that is something that I hinted at in my final text. Should we be concentrating the power of so many elected officials in the hands of so few? No. Is it fair? No. Injustice and concentration of power is something that tends to get people to sit up and pay attention. 

In terms of data visualization changes, I focused a lot of my changes since Part Two on the color palette of the graphs. I kept blue for government but made it a less agressive shade of blue. I also swapped out the bright yellow in favor of gray, as nearly all of my users told me to do. Now my dataviz is telling a story and supporting my main points, but it's not aggressively vying for attention or trying to tell the audience too many things at once. Something important to me in telling the story of local government was to make my data visualizations look trustworthy and dependable. In a context where people already have trouble trusting the government, people should be able to look at a chart and know what it's telling them and trust the data. 

Overall, the final project was a great process for me to apply everything that I have learned about telling a story through data, but the most helpful aspect was getting critical feedback from others. The time and effort and passion for the topic will mean little if I'm not effectively conveying it to others, and feedback is not something that only happens at the end. Gathering feedback throughout gave me a new appreciation for telling my story.
