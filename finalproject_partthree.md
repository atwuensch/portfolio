## Part Three

My user interviews in Part Two really helped clarify the changes I needed to make to finish up my project. Something that was at first a little muddied and unclear to me was who my audience would be. I think that in the back of my mind, I love local government so much and am so passionate about it that I also want other people to be passionate about it. However, while you can try to persuade people, you can't necessarily make them care, so it helped distill my points more to imagine reaching an audience who was already civically engaged, in community groups or otherwise, in and around Allegheny County and Pittsburgh. My audience cares about what is happening in their community already and are actively seeking other ways to improve it. They may not be aware of the power of local government, as many people aren't. To that end, I added more text on why it matters to be involved in local government. To be honest, I struggled with that a bit because I already care so much, and it was helpful to be reminded in my user feedback and other feedback that it's not that people don't care, they just don't know what I'm talking about.
