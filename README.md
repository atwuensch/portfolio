This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU.

# About me

My name is Alison Wuensch. I am a graduate student at Heinz College, getting my Master of Science in Public Policy and Management (MSPPM). After I graduate in May, I intend to work in local government in Allegheny County. Currently, I work for the Borough of Churchill as a Community Development Specialist. 

# What I hope to learn
I love public finance, budgets, and taxes, and part of my work at the Borough of Churchill has included working on the annual budget. One of the challenges was how to communicate more effectively to the citizens the overall themes of the budget in a way that feels concrete so people know where their tax dollars are going. We tried to accomplish some of that through visualizations, but I am hoping to learn how to visualize public financial goals in a more effective way.
