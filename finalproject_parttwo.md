# Final Project
## Part Two
### Wireframes/Storyboards in Shorthand
I wireframed my data visualizations in Flourish and embedded them into a draft of my story in Shorthand. This helped me both understand Shorthand better and get visual context for how my data visualizations would look in the context of my story. This also allowed me to easily present my story and visualizations to my users for user research.

### User Research
#### User Research Protocol
In developing my user research protocol, my main goal was to find out whether the story was engaging or not. Many people who are not already interested in government will tune out when discussing government, and my goal was to find out if I could keep users engaged enough that they would respond positively to my call to action. I also wanted to know if the data visualizations and the overall layout made sense to them. 

##### Target Audience
My target audience is people who are interested in making change in and bettering their communities and getting involved, but don't know exactly how to do that. I am presenting them with an easy option for getting involved and to make government seem like an ally for change rather than an obstacle. 
##### Approach to Finding Individuals
I wanted to find individuals who are not necessarily involved in the government but have been involved in their communities and would like to see change. 
##### Interview Script and Questions
I wanted to keep the script and questions simple and straightforward so the users felt they had room to share the direction of their thoughts after seeing my draft. They were also coming from different backgrounds, and I wanted to leave room for their different perspectives on my topic and draft to come through. 

Brief introduction – “This is for my Telling Stories with Data class, and I’m seeking feedback on my project. My goal today is to get feedback on whether the story makes sense, whether it is engaging, and whether the visualizations make sense. There are no wrong answers, and all the feedback will be anonymous.”

”I’m going to show you a draft version of the page for my presentation. I would like to hear your thoughts as if you just clicked on this link that I sent you without having further context. I’m going to ask you a few questions after you look at it.”

“Can you tell me what you think this is?”
“Can you tell me who you think this is for?”
“What other questions or comments do you have about this page?”

##### Findings
##### User #1 - Adult, early 60's
User #1 thought it was about increasing engagement for people who aren't necessarily already engaged in government. They thought it was not geared towards the general public, but more for people trying to work on the issue of engagement, such as community groups. They also thought it presented like a PowerPoint presentation instead of a web page. They said it's good information, as it's a constant challenge to get people engaged. They were president of their neighborhood association, and the challenge was always getting people to care enough to talk about what's going on. They said people like to complain about government, but they don't really understand it. They also suggested emphasizing the social aspect. 

##### User #2 - Teacher, late 20's
User #2 thought it was an overview on civic engagement and the lack thereof, and provides a bit of a call to action, like "You could be civically engaged, too." They suggested the audience is residents of Allegheny County who are of voting age. They thought the graphs were good for the most part, and they liked how you could hover over them to interact with them. They also thought it was a good balance of types of graphs. There's not an overwhelming amount, they kept your interest, and they weren't so new and different that they were confusing. They also thought there was a good balance between data visualizations, more dense blocks, and section headings. They did suggest that the donut chart is confusing and to make the icon chart bigger so you could understand the scale better. They also mentioned that not everyone knows where State College is. 

##### User #3 - Student, early 30's
User #3 suggested changing the color schemes of the data visualizations to better highlight key aspects. In particular, they suggested changing the colors for the slope graph to emphasize local government, if that was the point. They said it was difficult to distinguish between the lines for state and federal government. They also suggested changing the treemaps so that the yes answers were on the left, not the right, since that is the direction in which English readers move. They also suggested changing the yellow to something else, maybe gray.  
##### Changes to Implement
##### Based on User #1's Feedback
User #1 made a good point that this likely is not for the general public but for people already interested in engagement, as I identified my audience. Their feedback helped to reinforce that. However, another good point was that people don't necessarily understand the government and how it works very well, so I would like to provide a little more contextual information on how this will help local governments and what information is available for people and who they can contact. I will also emphasize the social connection aspect and maybe include a separate section on their social media and current events for people to attend. 

##### Based on User #2's Feedback
I will fix the donut chart to make it less confusing and clarify why I chose Pennsylvania cities (including State College) as a comparison point instead of all 50 cities identified. I will also make the icon chart larger and more prominent. Additionally, they did not feel the call to action was prominent, so I will include more lead in for the call to action and make it more engaging and show the impact it will have. 

##### Based on User #3's Feedback
I will change the color palettes of the charts to remove the yellow and include gray. I will also reorient the treemaps so they read from left to right. I will also use colors to emphasize trust in local government more in the slope chart and choose different colors for state and federal government.
