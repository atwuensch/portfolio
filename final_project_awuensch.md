# Final Project
## Part One
### Project Summary
My final project is about civic participation and engagement in local government in Allegheny County. Using data from Allegheny County specifically, as well as national data, my goal is to illustrate the importance of engaging with local government, particularly as a means of rebuilding trust in the government. I work in local government, and many people are skeptical as to whether we as staff are doing a competent job. They have ideas of how their local government should be run, which is good. However, oftentimes they have not engaged meaningfully with their local government staff and elected officials before making suggestions. We are very transparent about how we use our time and their tax dollars, but people don't always know that information is out there. I want to empower people to work with their local government and figure out what it can do for them. I want people to have the trust and the tools they need to share ideas on how to improve the community. People don't always realize it, but local government officials and staff make decisions that directly impact their everyday lives, and most local governments want citizen input on how they can improve. Local government can empower meaningful community chanage, and my goal is to empower people to do that. 

### Project Structure
#### Setup
I will begin by discussing public trust in the US government at the federal, state, and local level. I won't dwell on it, but I will emphasize the lack of trust in the federal and even the state government before highlighting the fact that most people trust their local government. I will speak a bit to why that is and why polarization has not had as dramatic an impact on politics and policy at the local level. 

#### Conflict
I will then move on to discuss how much impact local government has on people's daily lives, probably more than people realize. It has the potential to impact people negatively, but it also has the potential to become a vehicle for change at the community level, which is an underutilized power. I will demonstrate how little people are actually paying attention to local government, citing data from the national level on poor municipal voter turnout levels and civic engagement levels, then narrowing in on similar data for Allegheny County. 

#### Resolution
My call to action will be to show case studies of local governments that are trying to engage their citizens in innovative ways, including the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. I will illustrate that the government wants your opinion and is open to suggestions.

I intend to use Shorthand to build my final project. I will use Flourish and Tableau to create my data visualizations to embed in my final project on Shorthand.
