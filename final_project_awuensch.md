# Final Project
## Part One
### Project Summary
My final project is about civic participation and engagement in local government in Allegheny County. Using data from Allegheny County specifically, as well as national data, my goal is to illustrate the importance of engaging with local government, particularly as a means of rebuilding trust in the government. I work in local government, and many people are skeptical as to whether we as staff are doing a competent job. They have ideas of how their local government should be run, which is good. However, oftentimes they have not engaged meaningfully with their local government staff and elected officials before making suggestions. We are very transparent about how we use our time and their tax dollars, but people don't always know that information is out there. I want to empower people to work with their local government and figure out what it can do for them. I want people to have the trust and the tools they need to share ideas on how to improve the community. People don't always realize it, but local government officials and staff make decisions that directly impact their everyday lives, and most local governments want citizen input on how they can improve. Local government can empower meaningful community chanage, and my goal is to empower people to do that.
